You are the only one who understands the difficulties of handling your small business's money. To put it mildly, making sense of your figures can be time-consuming and irritating. It's no surprise that so many small business owners have sought respite from outsourced bookkeeping services to identify crucial financial insights.

But, what exactly is outsourced business bookkeeping, and is it a realistic option for you?

**What is the definition of** [**outsourced bookkeeping?**](https://www.tenxadvisory.com/bloglist/bookkeeping/)

Accounting is not to be confused with bookkeeping, which is primarily concerned with the documenting of transactions.Accounts entail:

* Examining financial accounts and operating costs
* Adjusting entries are used to record expenses that were not recorded by the bookkeeper.
* Completing tax returns and planning for the future
* calculating the financial consequences of business actions, examining cash flow, and assessing a company's overall financial health and profitability. Simply put, outsourcing accounting entails contracting a third party to take care of all or part of your accounting needs.

So, what are some of the advantages of outsourcing accounting?

**Why would you want to** [**outsource your bookkeeping?**](https://www.tenxadvisory.com/bloglist/kuwait-1/)

Computerized accounting services that are outsourced can help with:

**You will save time.** The most obvious advantage is that it allows you to focus on other everyday obligations, even ones that directly create income. However, locating a trustworthy accounting firm to assist you takes significantly less time than locating, employing, and onboarding an in-house accountant.

**You will save money.** It is also less expensive to outsource accounting than to hire an in-house accountant. After all, it takes care of office supplies, taxes, employee benefits, accounting software, and other costs.

**Make it easier to scale.** As your business grows and changes, your accounting needs will probably change as well. But it may not be possible or ideal to create a full-fledged internal accounting department. If you outsource to a flexible partner, you won’t need to.

**Reduce errors.** If you’re not an accounting pro, it can be easy to make financial reporting mistakes. These can leave you overpaying in taxes or, even worse, underpaying, which can get you fined by the IRS. For many growing companies, having experts on their side is a welcome layer of protection against such issues.

Outsourced accounting has many advantages. But how does it stack up to alternative solutions?

**To outsource or not to outsource?**

Ultimately, the best route for you will depend on several factors. Be sure to consider all of the following.

[Your budget](https://www.tenxadvisory.com/bloglist/bookkeeping-1/)

As with any service, the cost of outsourced accounting varies by provider. The same goes for payment terms, since some charge by the hour and others by the month. Therefore, your decision will require some budgeting on your end to see what you can afford—whether it be an accounting partner or an alternative.

If you do decide to pay a third party to handle your accounting, be aware of the potential for scope creep. You’ll want to set clear expectations from the start about the scope of work, not to mention how to handle any tasks outside of that scope, especially if you’re paying hourly. An early and open discussion about this can keep you from being hit with unexpected costs down the line.

**The security of your financial data**

Cash flow, balance sheets, financial statements, and the like are all sensitive, confidential information. You wouldn’t want any of it to fall into the wrong hands. So understanding how an accounting partner or tool protects your financial information before you share it is essential.

**Your current and future accounting needs**

Do you or will you need comprehensive financial services? Or would help in just a few areas be sufficient? Your answer will reveal the right accounting solution for your company. (Ideally, you’ll want one that works now and that’s flexible enough to adapt to future business needs as well.)
